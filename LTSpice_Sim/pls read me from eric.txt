LT spice interface is crustier than...
Also, its super crusty on Mac

Here are the must knows: 
0. The simulation file is the .asc file

1. To edit ANYTHING you see on the schematic, just right click it.
	-eg. to change resistor value, just right click on the number you see to edit.
	-to run the simulation, click the running lizard.

2. Click the icon with the graphs to view the simulation output (its called a trace).

3. Right click anywhere in the trace window to add traces. I've tried to label them logically.

4. .ic is initial conditions. I've set it to 3.3V so your computer doesn't explode trying during the transient analysis.

5. .tran is transient analysis, 10m is 10 milliseconds runtime. 10ms seems plenty to get us to steady state.

6. keyboard shortcuts for the simple things:
	-r for resistor, c for capacitor, d for diode etc
	-delete key to delete.
